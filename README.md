# IoT first assignment

This is the first assignent of IOT course for Engineering in Computer Science, Sapienza University of Rome.

Due to a mistake each sensor in the very first release produced only one value. Now each MQTT client produces a collection of values, while the dashboard plots each graph twice, so that values from the same sensor of different stations are overlapped.
